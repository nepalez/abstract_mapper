    # A special type of the composed node, that describes transformation,
    # applied to some level of nested input.
    #
    # Unlike the simple node, describing a transformation of data, the
    # branch carries a collection of subnodes along with methods to [#update]
    # itself with the same attributes and different subnodes.
    #
    # Tne branch only stores subnodes and composes transformations.
    # Its has no access to DSL and knows neither how to build a tree
    # (see [AbstractMapper::Builder]), nor how to optimize it later
    # (see [AbstractMapper::Optimizer]).
